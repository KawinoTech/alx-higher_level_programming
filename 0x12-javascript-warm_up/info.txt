To ensure your JavaScript modules pass a coding style check similar to **`pycodestyle`** (used for Python), you can use **JavaScript linters** and **formatters** like **ESLint** or **Prettier** with a specific configuration to enforce a style guide like **semistandard**.

**Semistandard** is a subset of the **StandardJS** style guide that enforces a more lenient rule set (e.g., it allows semicolons). Here's how you can test your JavaScript code against **semistandard** format.

### **Step 1: Install ESLint and Semistandard**

1. **Install ESLint** globally (optional but recommended for global use) and locally in your project.
   
   ```bash
   npm install eslint --save-dev
   ```

2. **Install semistandard**:
   
   `semistandard` is a pre-configured ESLint setup based on the StandardJS style guide that allows semicolons.

   ```bash
   npm install semistandard --save-dev
   ```

### **Step 2: Configure ESLint to Use semistandard**

You can configure ESLint to use **semistandard** by extending the semistandard configuration in your projectâ€™s ESLint setup.

1. **Create an ESLint configuration file** if you don't already have one:
   
   ```bash
   npx eslint --init
   ```

2. **Extend semistandard** in your `.eslintrc.json` or `.eslintrc.js`:

   ```json
   {
     "extends": "semistandard"
   }
   ```

3. You can also add any other customization you need in your `.eslintrc.json` file.

### **Step 3: Run ESLint to Check Your Code**

Once everything is set up, you can run ESLint on your codebase to check if it adheres to the **semistandard** rules.

```bash
npx eslint .  # Lint all files in the current directory
```

Or, specify a particular file:

```bash
npx eslint myfile.js
```

### **Step 4: Automatic Fixes with ESLint**

ESLint can also automatically fix some formatting issues, such as missing semicolons, incorrect indentation, or extra spaces.

```bash
npx eslint --fix
```

This will automatically fix most common issues in your JavaScript files.

### **Step 5: Using Prettier for Code Formatting (Optional)**

If you want to automatically format your code according to the semistandard style (like `pycodestyle` does for Python), you can use **Prettier** alongside ESLint.

1. **Install Prettier** and its ESLint plugin:

   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev prettier eslint-plugin-prettier eslint-config-prettier
   ```

2. **Configure ESLint to use Prettier**:
   
   Update your `.eslintrc.json` or `.eslintrc.js` to include Prettier configuration:

   ```json
   {
     "extends": [
       "semistandard",
       "plugin:prettier/recommended"
     ]
   }
   ```

3. You can run **Prettier** to format your files:

   ```bash
   npx prettier --write .  # Format all files in the current directory
   ```

   This ensures consistent formatting, matching the semistandard style.

### **Step 6: Testing Your Code in CI/CD**

To enforce code quality in a team or production environment, you can integrate these tools into your **CI/CD pipeline**. For example, using Git hooks with **Husky** can run ESLint and Prettier before commits or pushes to ensure code quality is maintained.

1. **Install Husky** for Git hooks:

   ```bash
   npm install husky --save-dev
   ```

2. **Add pre-commit hook** to run ESLint and Prettier:

   ```bash
   npx husky-init
   npm install
   ```

3. Modify the `pre-commit` hook to run linting and formatting:

   ```bash
   "lint": "eslint --fix",
   "format": "prettier --write ."
   ```

   This ensures that your code is always checked for style before being committed.

### **Summary of Steps**
1. Install **ESLint** and **semistandard**.
2. Configure ESLint to extend `semistandard`.
3. Run ESLint on your codebase to check for style issues.
4. Optionally use **Prettier** for automatic formatting.
5. Integrate with **Husky** for pre-commit hooks to enforce style checks.

This process will help you ensure your JavaScript code follows the **semistandard** style and maintain clean, consistent code across your project.
